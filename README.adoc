== Frontmatter

This is the general steps in order that I use to setup a new Mac

== Homebrew

Install {uri-homebrew}[Homebrew] via the CLI

[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
----

== Ansible

Install Ansible

[source,bash]
----
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible
----

Create directory structure for Ansible

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p $USER/Projects/mantoso/ansible/roles
cd $USER/Projects/ansible
----

I clone {uri-mantoso-role-homebrew}[mantoso-role-homebrew] via ssh, you might want to clone via https

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:mantoso/mantoso-role-homebrew.git
----

Create the playbook

[source,bash]
----
cp roles/mantoso-role-homebrew/homebrew-playbook-example.yml homebrew-playbook.yml
----

Or if you are ok with the example playbook, create a symlink to it:

[source,bash]
----
ln -s $(pwd)/roles/mantoso-role-homebrew/homebrew-playbook-example.yml $(pwd)/homebrew-playbook.yml
----

Run ansible-playbook

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass homebrew-playbook.yml
----

== Dotfiles

I have {uri-setup-dotfiles}[a script] to symlink dotfiles that I store in iCloud so that my dotfiles are in sync across all my Macs.

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Settings/dotfiles
./setup_dotfiles.sh
----

== ZSH

This {uri-my-zsh}[zsh configuration] is for my macOS workstation and therefore contains some macOS-specific code and commands.

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:tracphil/my-zsh.git ~/.my-zsh
zsh ~/.my-zsh/bootstrap.sh
----

If your default shell is not `zsh`, make it zsh and open a new terminal and plugins will automatically start installing. When opening the new terminal you will most likely be presented with the following:

[source,bash]
----
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? y
----

After the plugins are finished installing, fix the permissions.

[source,bash]
----
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
----

In case you want to have private setting excluded from public Git repos, just create a file `.private.zsh` in the home directory.

== iTerm2

I use iTerm (installed via {uri-mantoso-role-homebrew}[mantoso-role-homebrew]) and "sync" my settings via iCloud and have iTerm configured to load its configuration from a directory in iCloud Drive on my local Mac.

[source,bash]
----
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2.plist PrefsCustomFolder -string ${HOME}/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Settings/iTerm2
defaults write com.googlecode.iterm2.plist LoadPrefsFromCustomFolder -bool true
----

Open iterm and enjoy computing as it should be enjoyed.

So that {uri-powerlevel10k}[Powerlevel10] works in all its glory, go into Preferences for iTerm and change the font to SauceCodePro Nerd Font, 11pt.

menu:Preferences[Profiles > Default > Text > Font]


== GnuPG (wip)

Setup {uri-gnupg}[GnuPG] (installed via {uri-mantoso-role-homebrew}[mantoso-role-homebrew]) and `pinentry-mac`

[NOTE]
====
`pinentry-mac` connects `gpg-agent` to macOS Keychain via the brew-installed pinentry-mac program from GPGtools. This is the macOS _magic sauce_, allowing the gpg key's passphrase to be stored in the login keychain, enabling automatic key signing.
====

Setup git:

WARNING: In the examples below, replace C14AB940 with your key id.

[source,bash]
----
$ git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
$ git config --global user.signingkey C14AB940
$ git config --global commit.gpgsign true
----

Test it:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir -p /tmp/test
$ cd $_
$ git init
$ git commit --allow-empty -m 'signsss'
----
